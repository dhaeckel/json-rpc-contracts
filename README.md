# JSON-RPC Contracts

JSON-RPC Contracts is a set of interfaces and data transfer objects for a small framework to create json rpc 2.0 servers.
Note that JSON-RPC 1.0 is not supported, and there will be no effort to do so.
The goal is to work similar to psr-15 http-handlers for easy adoption when you're familiar with these.
